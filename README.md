# Stream Schedule Template

This repo is meant to be a basic html template that streamers can use to make schedules. You just need to adjust the text/images then take a screenshot. Then crop out the green parts and you're done.

Couple of notes
* schedule title I made as an image that was 1798 x 184. Could replace this with text if you want.
* If you want to make a day into an "off" day just add the class. 
* If you need to adjust the background image for a day edit the object position in the `.sun-art img` rule.
* big art can be adjusted in the `.art-background img` rule.
